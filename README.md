## Week Five Homework

### Logic Statement Practice

#### Part One
Implement the following functionality using if/else statements and booleans. Write a method that fulfills the following requirements:
1. Output "WHOA" if x is greater than 10
2. Output "whoaaaa" if x is less than or equal to 10, but not negative
3. If x is greater than 14 but less than 100, and x is even, output "Penguin". 
4. If it is greater than or equal to 100 and it is less than or equal to 1000, or, if x is odd, then output "Giraffe". 
5. Otherwise, output "Caballo"

#### Part Two (if you didn't get to this during class)

Create your own method that takes an input, and uses an `if` statement including at least four different conditions (aka you must use two `elsif`'s and an `else`).

#### Part Three (if you didn't get to this during class)

Try writing a program which asks us to type in as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line), and which then repeats the words back to us in reverse alphabetical order
